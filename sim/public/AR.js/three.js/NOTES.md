# What if we actually reach 60fps on mobile phones ?
- It works on any phone with a camera.
- So everybody with a modern mobile phone can use augmented reality
- performance are impressive on high-end phones.

- Suddently perforamces are getting very good. Good enougth to be used confortably.
- what does this change ?
- it seems to be a game changer.

# Focus on this AR setup
- the device is one phone, so handheld.
- No stereo, you hold it in your hand, not in a head-mounted-display
- you got a touch screen. easily clickable anywhere on the viewport. no mouseover
- you can have headset with microphone
- Speech API + voice recognition: you can tÂ£alk to your phone, the phone talk back to you

# Able to go mainstream ?
tldr; No good for mainstream public, but it is perfect to experiment today with Augmented Reality.

- artookit.js is perfect for experimenting, not really for mainstream
- artoolkit.js is doing markerbased positional tracking

- This requires to have a marker at a given position, you need to setup your environment
- markerless positional tracking doesn't need it, it is way more flexible.
- So for mainstream usage, markerless is definitly more confortable for the user.

- Nevertheless, markerless technology are pretty new
- markerless are not available in opensource, they requires to have specific license, and for-a-fee license.
- nothing bad with that. but it definitly make it 

# APP Model
- a normal webvr application played thru artookit's webvr polyfill
- aframe with multimarker, each marker is a experience in aframe
- three.js with multimarker, each marker is an app from three.js editor

# APP IDEA: Tamagotchi in AR on your mobile phone
- you virtual pet on your desk
- you can chat with it.
- you talk and the pet understand what you say. 

# APP IDEA: new resume
- all in #AR
- told by a minecraft characters
- some effect like starwar's hologram

# APP IDEA: annotate your world
- how to do an application to anotate your space.
- likely based on a barcode marker, very scalable
- for each marker, one can attach an anotation
- e.g. i put one marker near the fridge, and 
- what is an annotation ? it is a AR experience
  - three.js app from the editor ?
  - some aframe ?
- edit that content in VR ? maybe later. edit it on desktop for now
