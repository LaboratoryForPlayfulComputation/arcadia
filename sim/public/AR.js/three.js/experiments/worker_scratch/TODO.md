- his arworker is only
  - new
  - dispose
  - call function with callback or not
- do the same with each class controller/context


- make the initiliation of the video out of artoolkit.context
- it is just another class which feed the context
- it is required because the webworker doesnt have his own srcElement
- i can provide my own sourceElement to ArToolkitContext ctor
- DONE remove the three.js EventDispatcher
- remove three.js dependancy in worker ?

---------------------------------------------------
# Reuse his code ?
- so make jsartoolkit in worker
- and normal threex to use worker or not
- put all kind of marker in the barcode/pattern/nft/unknown
