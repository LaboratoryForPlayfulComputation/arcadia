# Area Learning with AR.js
## More stable more robust AR with multi-markers 


# intro - what is multimarkers
- before we had only one marker at a time e.g. give examples
- this is nice but we can go furthers.
- with multi-markers, we have multiple markers acting as one
larger marker. They have several keys advantages which allow 
to have more stable, larger AR with a more robust detection.
Additionaly we designed a user experience with a nice workflow 
to learn new areas of markers. 

# Advantages of multimarkers
Recently added multimarkers. It provides very nice features in AR
- *More Stable* : 
- *More Robust* :

So it ends with much larger augmented reality
(here video of large glass donut).

# Nice workflow for the user
- short descript of the steps
- a video showing the steps - with clear step 1/2/3 as captions

The workflow is splitted into 3 steps :

1. Learn the new area with multiple markers
2. Once learned, generate a file describing the area
3. Adding augmented reality on top of the area
