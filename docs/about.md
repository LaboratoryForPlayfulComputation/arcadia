## Building interactive tangible interfaces without electronics

ARcadia is a programming editor that uses Marker-based Augmented Reality to support the creation of paper-based tangible interfaces.

Augmented Reality is a real, live environment that is “augmented” by computer images. It’s a mixture of the real and the virtual.  

For example, see the below gif. You can see in the video that there is a purple cube that is on top of a cellphone, following as it moves. The cube is able to follow the phone because there is a marker that is displayed on the screen. The cellphone is part of the real-world, i.e. reality, and the purple cube is what we would consider a virtual object. The combination of these two gives us _augmented reality_.

The bridge between our real world and our virtual world in this application is enabled through the use of fiducial markers. Theses markers are 3x3 barcodes that provide our camera with a unique ID. In this application users can have up to 16 unique markers.
Using the markers allows us to turn physical objects in the real world into interactive elements that can control different kinds of software and hardware output.

You can begin building your own AR experiences at @homeurl@. Note: this editor is currently supported in the Chrome browser which you can download [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/). If you are using a mobile device only Android is supported.
