# About Microsoft Makecode for AR

You might be wondering what AR, or Augmented Reality, means. Well, augmented reality is defined as a real, live environment that is “augmented” by computer images. It’s a mixture of the real and the virtual.  

The bridge between our real world and our virtual world in this application will be through the use of markers. Markers are 3x3 barcodes that provide our camera with a unique ID. In this application you can have up to 64 unique barcodes.
Using the markers we can begin to build augmented reality experiences.
